# Loops
Learn about for loops, while loops, and do-while loops

```cpp
for ( expr1 : run once when loop starts; expr2 : condition ; expr3 : run every end of the loop){
  // condition is checked once

  // and also checked every time after the code in the block is done
  // the check is done however after the expr3 is ran
}

// checks if condition is true
while (condition) {

  // checks condition after the code block is done
}

// does not check for condition
do {
  // do some stuff...

  // and then condition is checked to see if the loop will be looped again
  // ensuring that the code will be ran at least once
} while (condition);
```
